# AssetInstancer

An old tool I made a year or so ago when learning C# & Unity Editor. `Tools/AssetInstancer`

Duplicates an asset & its dependents into a new folder, while also regenerating its GUIDs.

Made this tool so I could extract new clean copies of avatars I made in a bloated messy project, which would not overwrite anything when imported into a new project that may have shared the same assets. Was very useful when selling packages, making it possible for me to redistribute multiple packages sharing assets, that would not conflict when imported together.

Currently has a bug where you must specify *something* in the filter list, otherwise it will not function.

This is very old. This may explode. This could delete your house.
